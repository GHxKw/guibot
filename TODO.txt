- Implement global Settings() class that acts
  as a Singleton for all configuration settings.

  Move all hardcoded config values to this class.

- Test Qt4 Gui's text input fields. Implement drag'n'drop (perhaps
  two lists views) and test it.

- Make feature similarity more reliable. Currently it is defined as the ratio of
  keypoints through each feature matching filter. In case of successful matching
  the calibrate method thus optimizes the last ratio (matched / RANSAC inlier
  points) which is not always the best case according to the image logging.
  It is not important how many are the final matches, but how credible they are.
  The final homography only requires 4 matches (fundamental matrix requires 8).
  Figure out a similarity parameter that reflects this reliability.

- Implement a RigidMatcher that uses information on location in order to better
  select reliable matches. By restricting the kinds of possible transformations,
  all features can be selected based on their position relative to each other.
  This is a solution of the "spaghetti monster" problem of some feature matching
  where the final matches rely solely on descriptor similarity.

- Improve the twiddle() method of the calibrator to work with various parameter
  types. It has to guess the possible ranges of any parameter. Thus it should be
  able to calibrate all internal OpenCV parameters as well. Finally, twiddle()
  has to handle timing performance, i.e. convert slower results into errors.
