- Test Qt4 Gui's text input fields. Implement drag'n'drop (perhaps
  two lists views) and test it.

- Similarity and tolerance - for the variety of algorithms, there are
  different scales that can basically be suggested by the developer - 
  add some benchmarking functions and method suggestion functions to
  image finder (the developer can then decide for the best method for
  each image! - or test for various image categories like text, button, etc.)

- Implement a function to calibrate the image finder equalizer for a given image
  and return the calibrated parameters in order to save somewhere and use for
  this specific image. There is one famous AI technique that I saw in Stanford's
  online AI class, suggested by Sebastian Thrun.
