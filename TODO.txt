- Test Qt4 Gui's text input fields. Implement drag'n'drop (perhaps
  two lists views) and test it.

- Make feature similarity more reliable. Currently it is defined as the ratio of
  keypoints through each feature matching filter. In case of successful matching
  the calibrate method thus optimizes the last ratio (matched / RANSAC inlier
  points) which is not always the best case according to the image logging.

- Improve the in-house matching algorithm to perform ratio and symmetry test to
  increase the reliability of all matches with respect to the current provided
  BruteForce matchers. Our own matching algorithm will also be better suited to
  our matching needs which include homography and projection of match coordinates.
