Non-critical tasks:
- Qt4 Gui: Test text input fields
- Qt4 Gui: Implement drag'n'drop (perhaps two lists views)
- Test drag'n'drop

- Test other image detection based on "feature detection":
  Currently detecting text via images depends heavily
  on the font size. OpenCV also offers "feature detection".

  Test if feature based detection handles works
  better for smaller / bigger font sizes.

  If yes, then we can talk about adjust Image()
  to enable or disable feature based matching.

- sikuli has a "pyramid match". Figure out what it does
  (wild guess: Try different zoom levels of the same image?)
