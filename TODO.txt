- Test Qt4 Gui's text input fields. Implement drag'n'drop (perhaps
  two lists views) and test it.

- Implement a function to calibrate the image finder equalizer for a given image
  and return the calibrated parameters in order to save somewhere and use for
  this specific image. There is one famous AI technique that I saw in Stanford's
  online AI class, suggested by Sebastian Thrun.

- Improve the in-house matching algorithm to perform ratio and symmetry test to
  increase the reliability of all matches with respect to the current provided
  BruteForce matchers. Our own matching algorithm will also be better suited to
  our matching needs which include homography and projection of match coordinates.
