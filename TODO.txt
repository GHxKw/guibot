- Implement global Settings() class that acts
  as a Singleton for all configuration settings.
  Move all hardcoded config values to this class.

- Make feature similarity more reliable. Currently it is defined as the ratio of
  keypoints through each feature matching filter. In case of successful matching
  the calibrate method thus optimizes the last ratio (matched / RANSAC inlier
  points) which is not always the best case according to the image logging.
  It is not important how many are the final matches, but how credible they are.
  The final homography only requires 4 matches (fundamental matrix requires 8).
  Figure out a similarity parameter that reflects this reliability.

- Decide on whether to return needle center as done currently in the feature
  matching or the (0,0) needle location as done in the template matching.
