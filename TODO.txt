- Implement global Settings() class that acts as a Singleton for all
  configuration settings. Move all hardcoded config values to this class.

- Make feature similarity more reliable. Currently it is defined as the ratio of
  keypoints through each feature matching filter. In case of successful matching
  the calibrate method thus optimizes the last ratio (matched / RANSAC inlier
  points) which is not always the best case according to the image logging.
  It is not important how many are the final matches, but how credible they are.
  The final homography only requires 4 matches (fundamental matrix requires 8).
  Figure out a similarity parameter that reflects this reliability.

- Make CVEqualizer specific for each image, thus extending similarity with all
  settings helping to better match that particular image.

- Still reconsider whether to return the (0,0) needle point or its center since
  wild transformations are possible and defining the clicking point as (+n,+n)
  is not as consistent.
