- Test Qt4 Gui's text input fields. Implement drag'n'drop (perhaps
  two lists views) and test it.

- Currently detecting text via images depends heavily
  on the font size. Test if feature based detection handles works
  better for smaller / bigger font sizes. If yes, then we can talk
  about adjust Image() to enable or disable feature based matching.

- Similarity and tolerance - for the variety of algorithms, there are
  different scales that can basically be suggested by the developer - 
  add some benchmarking functions and method suggestion functions to
  image finder (the developer can then decide for the best method for
  each image! - or test for various image categories like text, button, etc.)

- Need an advanced method to analyze if the matcher returned a meaningful
  match to use for projecting the clicking point. Sometimes it returns a
  bunch of unrelated features giving 100% match (matched all). A guess is
  to analyse the mapping of features for continuity (Continuous functions in
  discrete space and some real analysis). We could even improve our own
  inhouse matcher with such ability.
