sikuli:
  - Grandfather of image based GUI automation
  - Development / maintenance stalled
  - Java based + dependencies on old libs

xpresser:
  - similar to sikuli
  - SCV in bazarr (no fun for me)
  - more "code" driven
  - uses SimpleCV / atspi as backend
    - lots of dependencies
    - SimpleCV f.e. converts images
      to greyscale before matching them
  - every screenshot is saved to disc

libcvautomation:
  - inspired by sikuli and xpresser
  - more bash oriented
  - python wrapper is incompleted as of Januar 2013

dogtail:
  - atspi driven (no image recognition)
  - written scripts are more complicated
    than they need to be
