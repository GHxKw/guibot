- GUI automation using computer vision + fuzzy images

*** Desired features ***
- Ready to use program that can load "scriptlets"

- Easy API - similar to sikuli or Xpresser
- Optional: Send e-mail on error
- Usable as class or procedural program

*** Dependencies ***
- autopy (autopy.org)
Later:
    - python-imaging for intenal Image storage
    - Cross-platform: Windows / MacOSX
    - docstrings everywhere
    - RPM package
    - Documentation

*** Later / ideas ***
    class Region:
            find_all(Image or filename)
            exists(Image or filename, seconds)         - no exception if not found
            wait_vanish(Image or filename, seconds)

            LATER:
            mouse_down()
            mouse_up()

            # LATER: drag()
            # LATER: dropAt()

            # LATER: wheel
            # LATER: key_down()
            # LATER: key_up()

*** Similar projects ***
sikuli:
  - Grandfather of image based GUI automation
  - Development / maintenance stalled
  - Java based + dependencies on old libs

xpresser:
  - similar to sikuli
  - SCV in bazarr (no fun for me)
  - more "code" driven
  - uses SimpleCV / atspi as backend
    - lots of dependencies
    - SimpleCV f.e. converts images
      to greyscale before matching them
  - every screenshot is saved to disc

libcvautomation:
  - inspired by sikuli and xpresser
  - more bash oriented
  - python wrapper is incompleted as of Januar 2013

dogtail:
  - atspi driven (no image recognition)
  - written scripts are more complicated
    than they need to be
