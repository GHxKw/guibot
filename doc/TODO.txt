MAIN
--------------------------------------
- Integrate some of the visualization code in the test_imagefinder into the
  ImageLogger and make improve its unit testing. Check the function draw_needle_features
  for any further detail.

- Maximum difference between the similarity obtained from the template and from the
  feature matching in the hybrid case may prevent from abnormal results in any of
  the two matching subparts.

- Calibrating is still not very used. It is really necessary but at the moment
  we need more manual experience in order to make it more usable. The ultimate
  calibration includes not just matching but also competitors, i.e. it doesn't
  just obtain the optimum similarity for the given needle and haystack but it
  minimizes the similarity for spatial and temporal competitors where spatial
  means the others in the same haystack while temporal extends it to others
  in nearby haystacks (time frames). A tool for this might even offer ways to provide
  the desired match so that even if it is suboptimal for the given parameters
  and another match is enhanced, this could be reverted with some parameters that
  could possibly be found through such calibration.

- Make feature similarity more reliable. Currently it is defined as the ratio of
  keypoints through each feature matching filter. In case of successful matching
  the calibrate method thus optimizes the last ratio (matched / RANSAC inlier
  points) which is not always the best case according to the image logging.
  It is not important how many are the final matches, but how credible they are.
  The final homography only requires 4 matches (fundamental matrix requires 8).
  Figure out a similarity parameter that reflects this reliability.

- Turn the getter methods at various classes into properties to make them more pythonic
  and preserve the restricted accessibility.

- Still reconsider whether to return the (0,0) needle point or its center since
  wild transformations are possible and defining the clicking point as (+n,+n)
  is not as consistent.

SECONDARY
--------------------------------------
- generate needle as difference of two images to create image variables
- ignore subregions while template matching to define frames of matching
- conditional matching - match needle if no other needle is matched
- match on still haystack as a wait to wait for some events to finish
- is idle() necessary?
- pressing multiple times the same key does not work
- add documentation everywhere (sample() and all simple methods as well)

DETECTED BUGS:
--------------------------------------
- Subregioning fails at certain cases resulting in a 0.0 template similarity no
matter whether we use hybrid, template or other method. At the image logging
one can observe that the second haystack (the region from the match of the
first region) is completely black and of really small size. This could of course
also be a problem of the image logging so more research is needed. For now, we
will wait for recurrence of this problem but we will keep it in mind.
