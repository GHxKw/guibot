- Integrate some of the visualization code in the test_imagefinder into the
  ImageLogger and make improve its unit testing. Check the function draw_needle_features
  for any further detail.

- Make feature similarity more reliable. Currently it is defined as the ratio of
  keypoints through each feature matching filter. In case of successful matching
  the calibrate method thus optimizes the last ratio (matched / RANSAC inlier
  points) which is not always the best case according to the image logging.
  It is not important how many are the final matches, but how credible they are.
  The final homography only requires 4 matches (fundamental matrix requires 8).
  Figure out a similarity parameter that reflects this reliability.

- Turn the getter methods at various classes into properties to make them more pythonic
  and preserve the restricted accessibility.

- Hybrid calibration or predefined best settings.

- Still reconsider whether to return the (0,0) needle point or its center since
  wild transformations are possible and defining the clicking point as (+n,+n)
  is not as consistent.

- generate needle as difference of two images to create image variables
- ignore subregions while template matching to define frames of matching
- match on still haystack as a wait to wait for some events to finish
- is idle() necessary?
- test if wait_vanish is really raising error if the object does not disappear
- pressing multiple times the same key does not work
