TODO - hierarchical notes
-------------------------

- new methods test stage
    - various collected strange cases (special testing pairs)
    - training a button cascade requires even more experience
        - reuse haystack images and localize some OK buttons
        - current choice: larger variety and distance (to positives) of data
        - play around with parameters (data augmentation, training, etc.)
    - advanced unit tests to include all backend types (desktop control)?
- other advancements
    - add useful core methods built in derived visual objects
    - generate needle as difference of two images to create image variables
    - ignore subregions while template matching to define frames of matching
    - match on still haystack as a way to wait for some events to finish
    - conditional matching - match needle if no other needle is matched
    - purely visual vs also behavioral intelligence (GUI handling)
- hybrid matching improvements - maximum difference between the similarity
  obtained from the template and from the feature matching in the hybrid case
  may prevent from abnormal results in any of the two matching subparts
- calibration and parameter optimization still not finished and fully used
      It is really necessary but at the moment we need more manual experience in
      order to make it more usable. The ultimate calibration includes not just
      matching but also competitors, i.e. it doesn't just obtain the optimum
      similarity for the given needle and haystack but it minimizes the similarity
      for spatial and temporal competitors where spatial means the others in the
      same haystack while temporal extends it to others in nearby haystacks (time
      frames). A tool for this might even offer ways to provide the desired match
      so that even if it is suboptimal for the given parameters and another match
      is enhanced, this could be reverted with some parameters that could possibly
      be found through such calibration.
- clicking target point - still reconsider whether to return the (0,0) needle point
  or its center since wild transformations are possible and defining the clicking point
  as (+n,+n) is not as consistent
