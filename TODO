TODO - hierarchical notes
-------------------------

- guibot init
    - website platform - quick one or django or both
        - bugzilla.guibot.org
        - git.guibot.org
        - download.guibot.org
    - build instructions for newbies including rpm packaging
    - identical module headers with copyright/license notice
- more and better unit tests
    - advanced unit tests to include all backend types (desktop control)?
    - apply hybrid backend to simplify some of them
- new methods test stage
    - various collected strange cases (special testing pairs)
    - training a button cascade requires even more experience
        - reuse haystack images and localize some OK buttons
        - current choice: larger variety and distance (to positives) of data
        - play around with parameters (data augmentation, training, etc.)
- other advancements
    - generate needle as difference of two images to create image variables
    - ignore subregions while template matching to define frames of matching
    - match on still haystack as a way to wait for some events to finish
    - conditional matching - match needle if no other needle is matched
    - purely visual vs also behavioral intelligence (GUI handling) - some
      reinforcement learning for behavioral intelligence in addition to image recognition
- teamfeat matching improvements - maximum difference between the similarity
  obtained from the template and from the feature matching in the hybrid case
  may prevent from abnormal results in any of the two matching subparts
- calibration and parameter optimization still not finished and fully used
    - add support for more matchers (CV backends)
- clicking target point - still reconsider whether to return the (0,0) needle point
  or its center since wild transformations are possible and defining the clicking point
  as (+n,+n) is not as consistent
